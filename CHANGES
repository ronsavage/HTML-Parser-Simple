Revision history for Perl extension HTML::Parser::Simple.

1.06  Sat Feb  5 15:57:00 2011
	- Fix a bug where, if the 2nd or subsequent attribute had an empty string for the value,
	  the code looped forever. Eg: name="a name" value="". For RT#65466.
	- Add corresponding test t/empty_attribute.t.
	- Clean up the code where the length of the attribute string was tested before spaces were trimmed.
	- Reformatted the source code and POD.

1.05  Sun Feb 21 12:55:17 2010
	- Remove text 'All rights reserved' (for Debian licensing).
	- Remove POD heads 'Required Modules' and 'Changes'.

1.04  Mon Jan 25 09:37:00 2010
	- Add MANIFEST and MYMETA.yml
	- Require Perl 5.6. Thanx to 'cpanservice' via GitHub
	- Reformat this CHANGES file

1.03  Fri Jun 12 11:49:00 2009
	- Improved tests and documentation (Mark Stosberg)
	- Added attribute parsing via HTML::Parser::Simple::Attributes (Mark Stosberg)

1.02  Thu Feb 26 11:24:00 2009
	- Rename scripts/parse.file.pl to scripts/parse.html.pl
	- Ship scripts/parse.xhtml.pl
	- Ship t/Data.pm to read in test data from t/data/
	- Rewrite t/*.t to use t/Data.pm
	- Patch Simple.pm to accept xhtml as a parameter to new
	- Patch Simple.pm to use xhtml in a few of places. XHTML support is not finished!
	- Patch Simple.pm to use accessors for object attributes as per PBP. Specifically:
	get/set_*() for current_node, depth, input_dir, node_type, output_dir, root, verbose, xhtml
	- Hence, rename root() to get_root()
	- Hence, rename verbose() to get_verbose()
	- Rename new_node() to create_new_node(), since that makes more sense when using get/set_*()
	- There are no methods get_result() and set_result(). The reason is efficiency. If we had
	$self -> set_result($self -> get_result() + '<tag>') it would mean duplicating the result so far
	each time a few chars were added
	- Ship various tests, with data, for XHTML
	- Add depth to the hashref of data for each tag's node in the tree
	- Put the code in github: git://github.com/ronsavage/html--parser--simple.git
